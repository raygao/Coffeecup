==What is CoffeeCup? 
Java has becoming one of the most popular programming language for the web programming. It has also been used for running enterprise level applications. Java uses CLASSPATH variables to glue components together in achieving modularity. Some times Java CLASSPATH could be very long. If you have any Java programming experience, you might already felt how tedious it was to type in the long java CLASSPATH variables at the command line. It could be even more painstaking to move and install new java applications. So, Mr.Raymond Gao wrote the CoffeeCup which can automatically generate the shell scripts with the corresponding CLASSPATH for you. That means that CoffeeCup will write out shell scripts with specified CLASSPATHs based on what you clicked at the GUI. CoffeeCup is the ultimate WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) tool for Java. CoffeeCup is a novel tool that can relieve you from tedious typing. It can help you saving your valuable time. Furthermore, you can even run your Java applications within the Coffeecup.
